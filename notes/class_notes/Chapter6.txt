Chapter 6: Transaction Management
6.1 Introduction
* A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations
  treated as a single logical unit of work.

Why to use Transaction ?
* Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency,
  particularly in the context of concurrent access and potential failures.

ACID Properties
Transactions in a database system must maintain the ACID properties:

* Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within the transaction
             are completed successfully. If any operation fails,
             the entire transaction fails, and the database state
             is left unchanged.

* Consistency: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another.

* Isolation: Ensures that transactions are isolated from each other, meaning the operations
        of one transaction are not visible to other transactions until they are completed.

* Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed,
           its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.

6.2 Controlling Transactions in JDBC
* In JDBC, transaction management is primarily handled through the Connection interface.

* By default, JDBC connections operate in auto-commit mode, where each individual SQL statement is treated as a transaction and automatically committed upon execution.

Step-by-Step Example:
1. Disable auto-commit mode.
To manually control transactions,
auto-commit mode must be disabled:

connection.setAutoCommit(false);

2. Committing a Transaction

Once all operations in a transaction are completed successfully, the transaction
can be committed:
connection.commit();

3. Rolling Back a Transaction
   If an error occurs, the transaction can be rolled back to undo all operations
connection.rollback();
