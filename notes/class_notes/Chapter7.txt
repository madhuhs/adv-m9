Chapter-7 : Exception Handling in JDBC

Types of Exceptions in JDBC
In JDBC, exceptions can broadly be classified into two types:

7.1.1 SQL Exceptions
SQLException: This is the base class for all SQL-related exceptions.

SQLWarning:A subclass of SQLException, representing warnings that can
occur during database access.

7.1.2 Java Exceptions
ClassNotFoundException: Occurs when the JDBC driver class is not found.
IOException: Can occur when there are issues with input/output
operations, particularly when dealing with LOBs (Large Objects).

7.2 SQLException and SQLWarning

7.2.1 SQLException

Description: An exception that provides information on a database access
error or other errors.
Common Causes:
* Invalid SQL syntax
* Connectivity issues
* Data integrity violations

7.2.2 SQLWarning
Description: A subclass of SQLException that represents database access
warnings.
Characteristics:
* Does not stop the execution of the application.
* Can be retrieved using the
* Statement, and ResultSet objects. method on Connection,

7.3 Handling SQL Exceptions

Basic Exception Handling

Handling SQL exceptions typically involves catching the SQLException and
performing appropriate actions such as logging the error, notifying the user, or retrying the operation.

Custom Exception Handling Strategies

Creating Custom Exceptions
Define custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios in a more meaningful
way.

Throwing Custom Exceptions

Convert generic SQLExceptions into custom exceptions to provide better
context.

Handling Custom Exceptions

Handle custom exceptions at higher layers of the application to provide user-
friendly error messages and perform corrective action


Use of Finally Block

Always use a block to close database resources (connections,
statements, result sets) to avoid resource leaks.
