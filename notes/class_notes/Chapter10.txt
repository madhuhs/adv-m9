Chapter - 10 : Best Practices and Security

 * Importance of Security in JDBC Securing JDBC code is crucial to protect sensitive data,
  prevent unauthorized access, and safeguard against common vulnerabilities such as
  SQL injection and data breaches.

  What is SQL Injection?
 * SQL injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to execute malicious SQL statements.
   This can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, or data theft.

  Preventing SQL Injection
 * Use Prepared Statements: As shown above, using PreparedStatement primary defense against SQL injection.
 * Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.



10.3 Performance Tuning

 * Optimizing Queries : Write efficient SQL queries to minimize execution time and resource usage.
                            * avoid unnecessary columns,
                            * Use indexing to make search faster
                            * prefer joins over sub-queries.

 * Connection Pooling : Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
                            Libraries like HikariCP or C3P0 can help improve performance and scalability.

 * Caching            : Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database
                            load and improve response times.

 * Batch Processing   : Use batch processing for executing multiple SQL statements in a single transaction,
                            reducing the number of database round-trips.

10.4 Resource Management
 * Always close database resources such as Connection,Statement and ResultSet to prevent resource leaks.
