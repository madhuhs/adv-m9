Chapter 9: Connection Pooling

9.1 Importance of Connection Pooling

9.1.1 What is Connection Pooling?
* Connection pooling is a technique used
  to manage a pool of database connections that can be reused across
  multiple requests.
* This eliminates the overhead of establishing a new connection for each request,
  thus improving the performance and scalability of database-driven applications.

9.1.2 Benefits of Connection Pooling
Performance Improvement : Reduces the time taken to establish and close connections,
                          resulting in faster database operations.

Resource Management     : Controls the number of connections to the database,
                          preventing resource exhaustion and managing load efficiently.

Scalability             : Supports a large number of concurrent database requests by efficiently
                          reusing connection

9.2 Implementing Connection Pooling
9.2.1 Using HikariCP :
      HikariCP is a popular high-performance JDBC connection pool library.
      It is lightweight, easy to configure, and provides excellent performance.

10.2.2 Basic Configuration with HikariCP

Step 1: Add HikariCP Dependency.
Step 2: Configure HikariCP Create a configuration class to set up the HikariCP connection pool.
Step 3: Using the DataSource Use the to get connections from the pool instead of creating
        new connections directly.


HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase");
config.setUsername("yourusername");
config.setPassword("yourpassword");

config.setMaximumPoolSize(10); // Maximum number of connections in the pool
config.setMinimumIdle(5); // Minimum number of idle connections
config.setConnectionTimeout(30000); // Connection timeout in milliseconds
config.setIdleTimeout(600000); // Idle timeout in milliseconds
HikariDataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);
