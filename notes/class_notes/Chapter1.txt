1.1 What is JDBC?
-----------------
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a standard API (Application Programming Interface) in Java that defines how a Java program can connect to and interact with a relational database. 

It allows Java applications to send SQL queries, retrieve results, and perform updates on databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle — in a database-independent manner.

Purpose:
* Before JDBC, developers had to use proprietary, vendor-specific APIs to communicate with databases. 

* JDBC unified this process under a single standard 
  interface.

Key Points:
✅ JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity – It’s part of the Java Standard Edition and is included in the java.sql package.

✅ JDBC provides database independence – You can write one set of code that can work across multiple databases by simply changing the driver.

✅ JDBC uses SQL for database communication – It sends SQL queries to the database and gets back results as objects (ResultSet).

✅ JDBC supports both read and write operations – You can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using it.

✅ JDBC follows a client-server model – The Java application acts as the client and communicates with the database server through the JDBC driver.

1.2 History and Evolution of JDBC
---------------------------------
JDBC was first introduced by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) in 1997 as part of Java 1.1. Over the years, it evolved to include modern features required by enterprise applications.

Major Milestones:
- JDBC 1.0 (1997): Basic database connectivity — connect, execute queries, and get results.
- JDBC 2.0 (1999): Introduced batch updates, scrollable and updatable result sets.
- JDBC 3.0 (2002): Added savepoints, auto-generated keys, and better connection pooling.
- JDBC 4.0 (2006): Introduced auto-closeable resources, XML support, and better exception handling.
- JDBC 4.1 (2011): Added support for try-with-resources statement.
- JDBC 4.2 (2014): Integrated with java.time API for better date/time handling.

1.3 Why Use JDBC?
-----------------
JDBC is the standard way for Java applications to connect to databases. Without JDBC, each database would require a separate, proprietary API.

Advantages of using JDBC:

1. Database Independence: Code written once can run on multiple databases by just changing the driver and URL.

2. Ease of Use: Simple API methods like executeQuery() and executeUpdate() make SQL operations straightforward.

3. Scalability: JDBC handles multiple connections efficiently using connection pooling and transactions.

4. Rich Functionality: Supports transactions, batch processing, metadata access, stored procedures, and large object (BLOB/CLOB) handling.

1.4 Overview of JDBC Architecture
---------------------------------
JDBC architecture consists of two layers:
1. JDBC API Layer (Application Side): Defines a set of interfaces and classes for database interaction (e.g., Connection, Statement, ResultSet).
2. JDBC Driver Layer (Database Side): A database-specific implementation that translates JDBC calls into database protocol calls.

Flow of JDBC Architecture:
1. Load the driver using Class.forName().
2. DriverManager registers the driver.
3. Connection is established with the database.
4. Statement or PreparedStatement executes SQL queries.
5. Results are returned in a ResultSet.
6. Close all resources.

Key Classes and Interfaces:
java.sql.Connection;
java.sql.DriverManager;
java.sql.SQLException;
java.sql.Statement;

- DriverManager    : Manages database drivers and 
                     connections.

- Connection       : Represents a live session with the 
                     database.

- Statement        : Used to execute SQL queries.

- PreparedStatement: Used for parameterized and 
                     precompiled queries.

- ResultSet        : Represents tabular data retrieved 
                     from the database.

-------------------------------------------------------------

1.5 JDBC API Components
-----------------------
The JDBC API resides mainly in the java.sql package and defines interfaces for interacting with databases.

Core Components:
1. DriverManager: Acts as the connection broker, loading drivers and establishing connections.

2. Connection: Represents a session with the database. Used for transaction management (commit/rollback).

3. Statement: Executes static SQL queries.

4. PreparedStatement: Precompiled SQL statement reused with different inputs; prevents SQL injection.

5. ResultSet: Holds query results and provides cursor-based navigation.

6. SQLException: Handles database access errors with detailed messages and error codes.
